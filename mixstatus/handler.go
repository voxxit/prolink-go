// - ComingSoon: A new track has been loaded.

// Additionally the following non-track status are reported:
//
// - SetStarted: The first track has begun playing.

// See Config for configuration options.
//
// Config options may be changed after the processor has been constructed and

// Track changes are detected based on a number of rules:
//
// - The track that has been in the play state with the CDJ in the "on air" state
//   for the longest period of time (allowing for a configurable length of
//   interruption with AllowedInterruptBeats) is considered to be the active
//   track that incoming tracks will be compared against.
//
// - A incoming track will immediately be reported as NowPlaying if it is on
//   air, playing, and the last active track has been cued.
//
// - A incoming track will be reported as NowPlaying if the active track has
//   not been on air or has not been playing for the configured
//   AllowedInterruptBeats.
//
// - A incoming track will be reported as NowPlaying if it has played
//   consecutively (with AllowedInterruptBeats honored for the incoming track)
//   for the configured BeatsUntilReported.
//
// - A track will be reported as Stopped when it was NowPlaying and was stopped
//   (cued, reached the end of the track, or a new track was loaded.
//
// - A track will be reported as ComingSoon when a new track is selected.
